Musefeed is a one-stop source for musical inspiration. With just a single search, you can read the lyrics to a favorite song or watch the music video via YouTube. Not sure what song to go to? Just search for an artist you'll get a sampling of their most popular videos.


## Summary
Upon accessing the MuseFeed landing page, the user is presented with the option to search for a musical artist (required) and a specific song by that artist (optional). Once the search is submitted, the app will make a request for data from the YouTube API and the Lyrics Apiseeds API. The request will return a selection of the most relevant YouTube videos and, where applicable, the lyrics to the song. The user will then be able to view any of the videos embedded on the page while reading the lyrics. If the lyrics are not found in the Lyrics database, the site will present the most popular videos for that song.
